  This command is generated when the MVM session is notified by one of the 
  streams or vocprocs attached to it that their configuration (i.e. media type, 
  topology, sample rates and/or KPPS requirements) has changed, which requires 
  MVM to re-calculate the timing offsets for this session, as well report the 
  configuration changes to the CCM, so that the CCM may set the clocks 
  accordingly and notify all other MVM sessions of the changes.
