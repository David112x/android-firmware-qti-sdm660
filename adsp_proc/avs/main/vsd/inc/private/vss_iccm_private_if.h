/**
  Event broadcast by the CCM to all active MVM sessions in the system,
  indicating the total number of nb/wb+ streams and vocprocs in the system.
 
  There are two possible events that can trigger the CCM to broadcast this event
  to all active MVM sessions:
 
    1. A #VSS_IMVM_EVT_VOICE_SESSION_ACTIVE event is receieved from an MVM
    session indicating to the CCM that it is going to voice active state.
 
    2. A #VSS_IMVM_EVT_VOICE_SESSION_INACTIVE event is received from an MVM
    session indicating to the CCM that it has gone to voice inactive state.
 
  Each MVM session receving this event utilizes the infomation provided to
  configure the voice path timing offsets for the streams/vocprocs connected
  to it.
 
  @par Payload
  #vss_iccm_evt_active_sessions_t
  
  @return 
  None.

  @dependencies
  None.
 
  @comments
  This event is sent only to sessions whose last status is known to CCM
  as active (i.e. their last notification was #VSS_IMVM_EVT_VOICE_SESSION_ACTIVE).
