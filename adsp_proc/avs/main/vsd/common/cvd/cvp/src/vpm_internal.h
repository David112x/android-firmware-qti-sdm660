     *     command such that it results in the vocproc to have different
     *     sample rates from those currently configured on the vocproc.
     *
     *   - upon the vocproc receiving a VSS_IVOCPROC_CMD_SET_DEVICE or
     *     VSS_IVOCPROC_CMD_SET_DEVICE_V2 command such that it results in
     *     the vocporc being re-initialized.
     *
     *   - upon the vocproc receiving a
     *     VSS_IVOCPROC_CMD_DEREGISTER_DEVICE_CONFIG such that it results in
     *     the vocproc to have a different rx sampling rate from what is
     *     currently configured on the vocproc.
     *
     *   - upon a new set of calibration data (either volume or common) being
     *     registered with the vocproc.
     *
     *   - upon the vocproc receiving a VSS_IVOCPROC_CMD_SET_RX_VOLUME_INDEX
     *     or VSS_IVOLUME_CMD_SET_STEP when the vocproc is in IDLE state such
     *     that it results in the vocproc to have a different volume level than
     *     what is currently configured on the vocproc.
     *
     *   - upon the vocproc receiving a VSS_IVOLUME_CMD_SET_NUMBER_OF_STEPS
     *     such that it results in the vocproc to have a different number of
     *     volume steps than what is currently configured on the vocproc.

     * current KPPS requirements of the vocproc. And the vocproc must be
     * reconfigured.
     *
     * The last two events do not change the current KPPS requirement. Note
     * that changing the volume level or the number of volume steps will not
     * cause additional modules to be enabled/disabled (assuming the volume
     * calibration data has been applied for a different volume level).
     * This is because by design, each volume level in the volume calibration
     * table uses the same set of module enable/disable parameters, and volume
     * level change only changes the gain-dependent parameter data values. But
     * the vocproc must be reconfigured in-order to apply the new volume
     * settings.
     *
     * Upon the vocproc receiving a VSS_IVOCPROC_CMD_ENABLE command, if
     * is_vocproc_config_changed is TRUE, and the vocproc is attached to an MVM
     * session, the vocproc will send a VSS_IVOCPROC_EVT_RECONFIG event to MVM
     * in order to notify MVM to reconfigure this vocproc.
     *
     * This flag is set to FALSE under the following circumstances:
     *
     *   - upon session creation.
     *
     *   - upon VSS_ICOMMON_CMD_SET_SYSTEM_CONFIG has been processed.

     *
     * Problem: In the current VCP architecture, issuing VPM_CREATE without Rx
     * or Tx AFE port results in the VPM not being created. As a result, any
     * attach of vocproc to stream before providing AFE ports, although it
     * reports success, is actually a no-op. This means following valid
     * sequence does not work:
     * 1. Create stream.
     * 2. Create vocproc with TOPOLOGY_ID_NONE and PORT_ID_NONE for both Tx
     *    and Rx.
     * 3. Attach vocproc to stream.
     * 4. SET_DEVICE on vocproc (with new topologies and port IDs).
     * 5. Run.
     * Although all the steps above will report success, there is no data
     * transfer, because step 3 is actually a no-op.
     *
     * Temoprary hack in CVP:
     *
     * 1. Set the AFE ports to AFE pseudo-ports upon vocproc creation if the
     *    Tx or Rx AFE ports provided by the client is
     *    VSS_IVOCPROC_PORT_ID_NONE.
     * 2. Keep a flag indicating whether the client has provided valid Tx or
     *    Rx AFE ports or not.
     * 3. If client attempts to RUN the vocproc without having provided valid
     *    AFE port, we will fail the RUN. This is to avoid running with some
     *    pseudo-port that perhaps Audio path is actually doing something with
     *    and picking up that data on the voice path.
