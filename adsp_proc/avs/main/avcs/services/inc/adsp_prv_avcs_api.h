    The physical_address field is automatically mapped in the aDSP before
    profiling starts, and is unmapped after profiling is complete. There is no
    need to send memory map commands before this command.
    @par
    The size field indicates how much space is reserved. If the entire
    profiling data does not fit in this field, the profiler sends partial
    profiling information covering as many software threads as will fit.

	 the physical address shared serves as a ping-pong buffer. Ping and pong buffers
	 each have a size of half the total size.

	 The meaning of the physical address is different when this command is sent from
	 client to ADSP vs. when ADSP raised events to the client.
