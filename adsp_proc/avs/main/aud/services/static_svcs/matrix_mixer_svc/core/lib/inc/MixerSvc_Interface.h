/**
  @brief Payload structure for the Matrix Register Underflow/Overflow message.

  This custom message is used to enable/disable the Rx or Tx audio matrix from
  reporting underflow or overflow events, respectively.

  -  The Rx audio matrix reports an underflow event to the client when an
     output port does not have data (the input buffer was not available in
     time), and it sends zeros downstream.
  -  The Tx audio matrix reports an overflow event to the client when an input
     port does not have output buffers.
     If the i/p port is live, the buffer is dropped.
     If the i/p port is non-live:
       For ADSP_ENEEDMORE error code, the buffer is retained until the resource (buffer) is available.
       However, for non-recoverable errors (all other error codes), that buffer is dropped.
