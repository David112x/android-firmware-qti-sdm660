/** @ingroup cvd_mvm_cmd_create_passive_ctrl
  Creates a new passive control MVM session.

  @apr_msgpayload
  The payload is the session name string used to identify the full control
  MVM session for which a handle is to be obtained. The string size, including
  the NULL termination character, is limited to 31 characters.

  @detdesc
  Passive MVM sessions give clients access to UI controls, such as
  @if OEM_only Teletypewriter (TTY) and @endif
  Wide Voice, as well as connections between streams and vocprocs. The
  corresponding full control sessions internally manage additional system
  policies such as network settings and voice timing parameter settings.
  @par
  Use the session name, <i>default modem voice</i>, to obtain a handle to the
  default MVM session for a circuit-switched voice call.

  The payload is the session name string given to the full control session

  @par
  If a name is supplied, it must be NULL terminated. A size zero name is

  the session.

  Full MVM sessions give clients full control over the voice system, including

  The session name, <i>default modem voice</i>, is reserved for the default MVM

  Stream and vocproc calibration is dependent on the Tx/Rx sampling rate. It
  is also dependent on the vocoder class if such calibration data is provided
  to the CVD.
  @par
  The CVD client must provide the calibration media type to the MVM, which
  uses it for two purposes:
  - Determining the Tx and Rx sample rates at which the system runs and for
    which the system is calibrated.
     - For fixed sample rate vocoders, the rates are then propagated to the
       streams and vocprocs attached to the system. Their sample rates are
       configured and indexed into the calibration table to apply the
       corresponding calibration data subset.
     - For variable sample rate vocoders, the MVM cannot determine the sample
       rates from the media type alone and requires the sample rates to be
       provided by the client; see #VSS_IMVM_CMD_SET_MAX_VAR_VOC_SAMPLING_RATE.
  - Determining the vocoder class and propagating it to the streams and
    vocprocs attached to the system. The class is indexed into the calibration
    table to apply the corresponding calibration data subset.
