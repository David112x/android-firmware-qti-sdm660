  vocoder PCM data buffer transfers. Only one vocoder PCM start is supported by
  the CVD module session at any given time.

  During a device switch, the client  must stop and reconfigure the

  the client must check the new configuration information from
  #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event.

  @dependencies
  Shared memory that that is used for vocoder PCM data buffer transfers must
  first be mapped with the CVD as specified in Section
  @xref{dox:ShMemGuidelines}.
  @par
  The memory must be valid until #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_STOP is successfully completed.
  @par
  If destroying the CVD module session while vocoder PCM is running, the
  memory must be valid until APRV2_IBASIC_CMD_DESTROY_SESSION is successfully

  Per tap-point vocoder PCM notification issued by the CVD. This event provides
  a buffer transfer notification to the client.

  @apr_msgpayload{vss_ivpcm_evt_notify_v2_t}
  @table{weak__vss__ivpcm__evt__notify__v2__t}

  @detdesc
  This event is also overloaded to provide the timetick and various
  information to the client, depending on the use case (e.g., requested output
  buffer size, requested input buffer size and sampling rate, input buffer
  consumed notification, and output buffer filled notification). The
  interpretation of this notification is indicated by the notify_mask in the
  payload.
  @par
  @keep{6} If the timetick bit of notify_mask is set, this notification is
  used as a timetick, which is issued to the client every x milliseconds,
  where x is the PCM frame size on which the VDSP operates, and denotes the
  boundary upon which PCM buffer transfers between the client and CVD occur.
  @par
  If the timetick bit is not set, a notify event is used for buffer
  notifications only. For an output or input error in the buffer operation, the
  corresponding error bit is set in the notify_mask.
  @par
  Each notify event can accommodate any combination of timetick,
  output buffer filled, or input buffer consumed masks.
  @par
  After a #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2 command is issued, a buffer transfer between
  the client and CVD starts when the client receives the first
  #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event (it cannot start before receiving the first
  event). The first notification is for buffer setup information only. The
  interpretation of #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 and the information it conveys to
  the client depends on the use case and the time when the information is
  issued. @vertspace{-3}

  @par Use case 1 -- Output only tap point
  First #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event after #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2:
    - notify_mask = 0.
    - Indicates the requested size of the output buffer to be provided by 
      the client.
  @par
  Subsequent VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 events:
    - Bit 0 of notify_mask is set.
    - Indicates the previously provided output buffer has been filled and its
      sampling rate and number of channels are as specified by sampling_rate
      and num_out_channels fields. This also indicates the size of the next
      output buffer to be provided by the client. @vertspace{-3}

  @par Use case 2 -- Input only tap point
  First #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event after #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2:
    - notify_mask = 0
  @par
  Subsequent VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 events:
    - Bit 1 of notify_mask is set.
    - Indicates that the previously provided input buffer has been consumed.
      This also indicates the size and sampling rate of the next input buffer
      to be provided by the client. @vertspace{-3}

  @par Use case 3 -- Output/input tap point
  The sampling rate of the input and output must always be the same in this
  case.
  @par
  First #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event after #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2:
    - notify_mask = 0.
    - Indicates the requested size of the output buffer to be provided by 
      the client. @newpage
  @par
  Second #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 event after #VSS_IVPCM_CMD_START_V2:
    - Bit 0 of notify_mask is set.
    - Indicates that the first provided output buffer has been filled and 
      its sampling rate and number of channels are as specified by the 
      sampling_rate and num_out_channels fields. This also indicates the size
      and sampling rate of the first input buffer to be provided by the client.
  @par
  Subsequent #VSS_IVPCM_EVT_NOTIFY_V2 events:
    - Bits 0 and 1 of notify_mask are set.
    - Indicates the previously provided output buffer has been filled and 
      its sampling rate and number of channels are as specified by the 
      sampling_rate and num_out_channels fields.
    - This also indicates that the previously provided input buffer has been
      consumed, and it indicates the requested size of the next output buffer
      and the requested size and sampling rate of the next input buffer.
