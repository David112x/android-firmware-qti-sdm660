/* Shared Memory Usage Guidelines *******************************************/
/** @weakgroup weakf_shared_mem_usage_guidelines
  This section describes the guidelines for using shared memory to share
  data between the client and the CVD.

  Before shared memory can be used, it must first be mapped with the MVM. The
  mapped memory is accessible by all sessions of all CVD modules.
  The client must not map the same piece of memory twice with the MVM.

  The client specifies the memory attributes in the memory mapping commands.
  The attributes are: 
  - Cached or uncached -- Whether the memory is cached or uncached
  - Cache line size if cached -- Minimum amount of data in bytes that can be
    affected by a single cache maintenance operation
  - Access permission -- Permission to access the memory after it is mapped,
    (the memory becomes readable and writable)
  - Page alignment -- Page frame alignment
  - Minimum native data type access width -- Minimum native data type width
    in bits that can be accessed
  - Maximum native data type access width -- Maximum native data type width
    in bits that can be accessed

  The CVD supports three types of shared memory:
  - Virtual memory -- Useful when the client and the CVD both see a unified
    virtual address space (such as when both the client and the CVD are on the
    same processor). For information on how to map virtual memory with the CVD,
    see #VSS_IMEMORY_CMD_MAP_VIRTUAL.
  - Contiguous physical memory -- Useful when enough contiguous physical memory
    is available. For information on how to map contiguous physical memory
    with the CVD, see #VSS_IMEMORY_CMD_MAP_PHYSICAL.
  - Non-contiguous physical memory -- Useful when enough contiguous memory is
    not available or not efficient (in terms of memory utilization) to
    allocate and multiple memory blocks are needed. For information on how to
    map non-contiguous physical memory with the CVD, see
    #VSS_IMEMORY_CMD_MAP_PHYSICAL.

  The CVD provides a handle to the client in response to the memory mapping
  commands. The handle encapsulates the shared memory attributes.

  After the memory is mapped, the client can use it for sharing data with the
  CVD by providing the location and size of the data in shared memory as well
  as the handle returned by the memory mapping command. The location of the
  data is specified as a memory address or an address offset depending on the
  type of the shared memory used:
  - Virtual memory 
    - The client specifies the virtual address to indicate the data location.
    - The CVD uses the virtual address directly to access the memory.
  - Contiguous physical memory.
    - The client specifies the physical address to indicate the data location.
    - The CVD does the physical-to-virtual address translation before
      accessing the memory. @newpage
  - Non-contiguous physical memory.
    - The client specifies an address offset to indicate the data location.
    - The offset begins from the client's starting virtual address of the
      memory. It is possible to use an offset because both the client and the
      CVD map non-contiguous physical memory to contiguous virtual memory.
      When the CVD first maps the memory, it obtains a virtual address,
      cvd_start_virt_addr. 
    - When an address offset is provided to indicate the
      location of the data, the CVD uses the cvd_start_virt_addr + offset to
     access the shared memory.

  When specifying the data location, any memory address or address
  offset provided to the CVD must be aligned to the lcm_align address.
  The address or address offset must also adhere to the memory
  attributes required for the region in which the memory address or offset was
  mapped, where lcm_align = LCM (cache line size, maximum native data type
  access width) and LCM = least common multiple. Also, the
  memory must be large enough to hold the data, and it must be a multiple of
  the cache line size.

  For the provided memory, the client must not use the
  subsequent padding bytes (if there are any) after the data for other
  purposes because cache maintenance operations, such as flushing, can affect
  the padding bytes.
