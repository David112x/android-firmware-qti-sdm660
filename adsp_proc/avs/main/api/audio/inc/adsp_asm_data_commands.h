  @detdesc
    If the client wants the aDSP to use valid timestamps in this command, and
    the data sent through this command is in RAW format, the last data
    byte must constitute an end of frame. The end-of-frame flag (bit&nbsp;4
    of the flags field) must be set to 1. Otherwise, the aDSP will not
    be able to handle the timestamps correctly, which can result in gaps
    during audio playback.
    @par
    When the buffer delivers uncompressed PCM data (in
    #ASM_MEDIA_FMT_MULTI_CHANNEL_PCM_V2 format), the buffer must contain the
    same number of PCM samples for all channels. If not, the aDSP discards the
    buffer and generates an #ASM_DATA_EVENT_WRITE_DONE_V2 event with the
    ADSP_EBADPARAM error code. (For more details on the error code, refer to
    @xrefcond{Q5,80-NF774-4,80-NA610-4}.)

  @return
    #ASM_DATA_EVENT_WRITE_DONE_V2 is raised when the buffer is fully consumed.

    The session/stream must be a valid and opened write or read/write
    session/stream.

         The timestamp of the first sample in this buffer continues from the
         timestamp of the last sample in the previous buffer.

         The samples in the current buffer do not have a valid timestamp in
         the following situations:
         - If there is no previous buffer (this buffer is the first
           buffer sent after opening the stream or after a flush operation)
         - If the previous buffer does not have a valid timestamp

         In these cases, the samples in the current buffer are played out as
         soon as possible.

         @tblsubhd{If bit 31=0 and bit 29=0}
         No timestamp is associated with the first sample in this buffer. The
         samples are played out as soon as possible.

         @tblsubhd{If bit 31=1 and bit 29 is ignored}
         The timestamp specified in this payload is honored.

         @tblsubhd{If bit 30=0}
         This buffer is not the last buffer in the stream. This case is useful
         in removing trailing samples.

         @contcell
         @tblsubhd{For bit 4}
         The client can set this end-of-frame flag for every buffer sent in
         which the last byte is the end of a frame. If this flag is set, the
         buffer can contain data from multiple frames, but it must always end
         at a frame boundary. Restrictions allow the aDSP to detect an end of
         frame without requiring additional processing. */
