         Bit 0 is the IsVirtual flag that indicates physical or virtual

                  avs_shared_map_region_payload_t is a physical address. The
                  shared memory must be mapped (a hardware TLB entry), and a
                  software entry must be added for internal bookkeeping.

         @contcell
         Bit 0 (cont.)
           - 1 -- The shared memory address provided in the map
                  payload[usRegions] is a virtual address. The shared memory
                  must not be mapped (because the hardware TLB entry is already
                  available), but a software entry must be added for internal
                  bookkeeping. \n
                  This bit value (1) is useful if two services within the aDSP
                  are communicating via the APR. They can directly communicate
                  via the virtual address instead of the physical address. The
