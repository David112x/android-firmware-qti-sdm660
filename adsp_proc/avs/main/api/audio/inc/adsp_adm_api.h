    Allows a client to control the gains on various session-to-COPP paths.

    targeted matrix. This command supports sessions opened by the ASM service
    only.

    Dst_port -- Ignored

  @apr_msgpayload{adm_cmd_matrix_ramp_gains_v5_t}
    @tablens{weak__adm__cmd__matrix__ramp__gains__v5__t}

  @par Session COPP gain type (adm_session_copp_gain_v5_t)
    This structure specifies the target gain (per channel) that must be applied
    to a specific session-to-COPP path in the audio matrix. The structure can
    also be used to apply the gain globally to all session-to-COPP paths that
    exist for the given session.
    @par
    The aDSP uses device channel mapping to determine which channel gains to
    use from this command. For example, if the device is configured as stereo,
    the aDSP uses only target_gain_ch_1 and target_gain_ch_2, and it ignores
    the others.
    @tablens{weak__adm__session__copp__gain__v5__t}

  @detdesc
    For every session-to-COPP path, the specified gains are channel specific
    and can be applied immediately or over a period of time in
    ramping fashion. The latter helps avoid a pop when the gain is changed.
    The client can specify the ramp curve, ramp duration, and step duration
    to indicate the kind of ramping required to achieve the target gain.
    @par
    The clients can specify gain ramps for multiple session-to-COPP paths at
    one time, improving synchronization. The client can also apply the gain
    ramp globally to all session-to-COPP paths that exist for the specified
    session.
    @par
    This command takes effect immediately upon receipt. It can be used for:
      - Controlling per-stream-per-device volume
      - Supporting multichannel (up to 7.1) gain settings
      - Soft-stepping during a stream's volume changes
    @par
    The client is responsible for maintaining a history of gain values
    for every channel in each session-to-COPP path because this command
    does not allow a client to specify new gain values for only some channels
    in a stream. The client must specify new gain values for all the channels.
    @par
    If the client wants to selectively change the gains of only some
    channels in an audio stream, it must still send this command with all the
    required target gains. For the channels on which the client does not want
    to change the gains, the client must specify its current gain as the
    target gain.
    @par
    The aDSP applies gain on a stream after reformatting, if required, to
    match the COPP's channel mapping. Therefore, the aDSP uses the COPP channel
    mapping information (from ADM_CMD_MULTICHANNEL_COPP_OPEN) to determine
    which gains to use from this command. Therefore, the client is
    responsible for sending this command with gain values set for exactly those
    channels on which the device is operating. For example:
      - If the audio stream is multichannel, the user sets a multichannel
        volume, and the device (and COPP) are configured to operate in Stereo
        mode -- the client converts the multichannel gain to stereo gain and
        sets gains for only two channels in this command. The aDSP ignores the
        remaining gain values. @newpage
      - If the audio stream is stereo, the user sets a stereo volume, and the
        device (and COPP) are configured to operate in 5.1 Multichannel mode --
        the client must convert the stereo gain to 5.1 gain and set gains for
        all six channels in this command.

  @par Session COPP gain type (adm_session_copp_gain_v6_t)
    This structure specifies the target gain (per channel) that must be applied
    to a particular session-to-COPP path in the audio matrix. The structure can
    also be used to apply the gain globally to all session-to-COPP paths that
    exist for the given session.
    @par
    The aDSP uses device channel mapping to determine which channel gains to
    use from this command. For example, if the device is configured as stereo,
    the aDSP uses only target_gain_ch_1 and target_gain_ch_2, and it ignores
    the others.
    @tablens{weak__adm__session__copp__gain__v6__t}

  @detdesc
    For every session-to-COPP path, the specified gains are channel specific
    and can be applied immediately or over a period of time in
    ramping fashion. The latter helps avoid a pop when the gain is changed.
    The client can specify the ramp curve, ramp duration, and step duration
    to indicate the kind of ramping required to achieve the target gain.
    @par
    The clients can specify gain ramps for multiple session-to-COPP paths at
    one time, improving synchronization. The client can also apply the gain
    ramp globally to all session-to-COPP paths that exist for the specified
    session.
    @par
    This command takes effect immediately upon receipt. It can be used for:
      - Controlling per-stream-per-device volume
      - Supporting multichannel (up to 7.1) gain settings
      - Soft-stepping during a stream's volume changes
    @par
    The client must specify new gain values for all the channels. This command
    does not allow a client to specify new gain values for only some channels
    in a stream. Therefore, the client is responsible for maintaining a history
    of gain values for every channel in each session-to-COPP path.
    @par
    If the client is to selectively change the gains of only some
    channels in an audio stream, it must still send this command with all the
    required target gains. For the channels on which the client does not want
    to change the gains, the client must specify its current gain as the
    target gain.
    @par
    The aDSP applies gain on a stream after reformatting, if required, to
    match the COPP's channel mapping. Therefore, the aDSP uses the COPP channel
    mapping information (from ADM_CMD_DEVICE_OPEN) to determine
    which gains to use from this command. Therefore, the client is responsible
    for sending this command with gain values set for exactly those
    channels on which the device is operating. For example:
      - If the audio stream is multichannel, the user sets a multichannel
        volume, and the device (and COPP) are configured to operate in Stereo
        mode -- the client converts the multichannel gain to stereo gain and
        sets gains for only two channels in this command. The aDSP ignores the
        remaining gain values.
      - If the audio stream is stereo, the user sets a stereo volume, and the
        device (and COPP) are configured to operate in 5.1 Multichannel mode --
        the client must convert the stereo gain to 5.1 gain and set gains for
        all six channels in this command.

    Deprecated. Use #ADM_CMD_MATRIX_MUTE_V6 instead.

  @detdesc
    The client can apply mute/unmute globally to all session-to-COPP paths that
    exist for the specified session. The aDSP uses device channel mapping to
    determine which device channel mute/unmute to use from the command. For
    example, if the device is configured as stereo, the aDSP uses only
    mute_flag_ch_1 and mute_flag_ch_2 and ignores the others. For every
    session-to-COPP path (stream-device interconnection), mute/unmute can be
    set individually on the output channels.
    @par
    The ADM_CMD_MATRIX_MUTE_V5 command:
      - Can be used for controlling per-stream-per-device mute/unmute
      - Supports multichannel mute settings (up to 8 channels)
      - Overrides any #ADM_CMD_MATRIX_RAMP_GAINS_V5 that might be called
    @par
    Example 1: Ramp_gain > Mute > Unmute sequence
      -# Mute is applied immediately.
      -# All ramps are canceled.
      -# On unmute, the target setting provided in the ramp_gain field is
        applied immediately.
    @par
    Example 2: Mute > Ramp_gain > Unmute sequence
      -# Mute is applied immediately.
      -# Ramps are not serviced.
      -# On unmute, the target setting provided in the ramp_gain field is
        applied immediately.
    @par
    On the playback path:
    - If the client wants to use this command as a stream mute command, it can
      set the #ADM_CMD_MATRIX_MUTE_COPP_ID_ALL_CONNECTED_COPPS for the copp_id.
      This command mutes all interconnections emanating from this stream.
    - If the client wants to use this as a device (n) mute command, it must
      provide the mute command to individual (stream 1, device n), (stream 2,
      device n) combinations. In this example, stream 1 and stream 2 mix into
      device n.
    @par
    The aDSP applies mute/unmute on a stream after reformatting, if required,
    to match the COPP's channel mapping. The aDSP uses the COPP channel
    mapping information (from ADM_CMD_MULTICHANNEL_COPP_OPEN) to determine
    which channels are muted/unmuted from this command. Therefore, the client
    is responsible for sending this command to mute/unmute exactly those
    channels on which the device is operating.
