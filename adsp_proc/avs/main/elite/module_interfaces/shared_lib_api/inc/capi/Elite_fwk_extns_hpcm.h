/** @addtogroup capiv2_ext_host_pcm
The #FWK_EXTN_HPCM framework extension allows a client to use a
client-specified sampling rate and receive or inject multichannel PCM data at
a specified tap point. HPCM operates seamlessly across handovers, without any
client knowledge.

HPCM exchanges PCM data with the client on a 20 ms timeline, which should be an
integer multiple of the timeline of the underlying tap point. PCM data exchange
is therefore synchronous to the tap point operation, and thus gives the client
a time trigger for driving its own buffer handling.

The PCM data exchange is signaled through events, which contain physical
address pointers to the actual PCM data held in shared memory buffers.
The client is responsible for proper memory mapping of the shared memory
regions used for PCM data exchange, and also for managing the pool of buffers.
A shared memory client buffer can hold multichannel, non-interleaved PCM data.
