@brief This file contains a utility to form a channel of a combination
of up to 32 signals, queues, and timers. The client can wait on
any combination of signals, queues, and timers and be awakened
when any desired element is active.

v2 is implemented to make qurt_elite independent of qurt.

/** @weakgroup weakf_qurt_elite_channel_utilsv2_intro
Version 2 of the channel utilities decouples QuRT_Elite from the underlying
QuRT functions, and thus provides better portability. Inline function and
inline structure definitions are removed. New functions are added to extend
version 1 of qurt_elite_channel.

Only the version 2 functions are documented in this section. The version 1
functions are documented in Section @xref{dox:ChannelUtilities}; they are not
repeated here.
 - qurt_elite_channel_create() -- Version 2
 - qurt_elite_channel_delete() -- Version 2
 - qurt_elite_channel_addq()
 - qurt_elite_channel_add_signal()
 - qurt_elite_channel_wait()
 - qurt_elite_channel_poll()
