/** @name Secondary Operation Codes

  The secondary operation code for ELITE_CUSTOM_MSG is 32 bits and
  must be globally unique. Individual services can define their globally
  unique secondary operation codes.

  The recommended method is:
  - The MSB 16 bits must be the MSB 16 bits of the service ID that defines
    this parameter ID. \n
  - The LSB 16 bits can be defined by the service itself.

  If the MSB 16 bits are all zeros, it indicates that this is a common (kernel)
  CUSTOM_MSG.

  The macros for the secondary operation codes are:
