  @note1cont In general, application code should "destroy" an pimutex2 object prior to

             that all qurt_pimutex2_unlock() calls have completed.

/**@ingroup func_qurt_pimutex2_lock
  Locks the specified recursive mutex. \n 

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a recursive mutex that is not being used, the
  thread gains access to the shared resource that is protected by the mutex, and continues
  executing.

  If a thread performs a lock operation on a recursive mutex that is already being used by
  another thread, the thread is suspended. When the mutex becomes available again
  (because the other thread has unlocked it), the thread is awakened and given access to the
  shared resource.
  
  @note1hang A thread is not suspended if it locks a recursive mutex that it has already
             locked, but the mutex does not become available until the thread performs a
             balanced number of unlocks on the mutex.

   awakened thread has higher priority than the current thread, a context switch occurs.
