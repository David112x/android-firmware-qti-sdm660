/*===========================================================================
 Note that these routines are FULLY re-entrant.  Furthermore, while
  performing memory allocation/deallocation calls on one heap, the routines
  may be interrupted to perform memory allocation/deallocation calls on
  different heaps without blocking or corruption.  However, should an
  interrupting task attempt to perform memory allocation/deallocation
  on the same heap that had a critical section interrupted, it will block
  allowing the first call to finish.  All this is accomplished by giving
  each heap its own semaphore.

FEATURE_MEMHEAP_MT
Activates multi threading support for the heap

  Usage Notes - Avoiding Fragmentation

1. If all bytes in the heap are freed, the heap is guaranteed to be returned
 to the same state as after a call to mem_init_heap, except that the
 values of maxUsed & maxRequest are not reset.  The order in which blocks
 are freed is irrelevant so long as they ALL are freed.

2. After n consecutive malloc/calloc calls, in a heap with non-fragmented
 free space (and no intervening realloc calls that return a new pointer),
 calling free in the reverse order on the n blocks guarantees that the heap
 will be returned to the exact same state as before the n alloc calls.

3. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 0
 (2) still applies, except the calls to free may be made in any order and
 after all n blocks are freed, the heap is guaranteed to be returned to the
 exact same state as prior to the n alloc calls.

4. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 1
 The overhead per heap block is 8 bytes.  However it's not possible to backup
 the next-block-to-start-searching-for-free-space pointer, so the heap MAY
 become more fragmented, but it MAY NOT -- it depends on the alloc/free
 calling patterns.

5. FEATURE_HEAP_SMALLER_OVERHEAD == 0
The overhead per heap block is 12 bytes.  Backing up is possible, so some
 fragmention that otherwise MIGHT occur can be prevented.  There is very little
 performance cost for this, the big expense is the additional 4 bytes of overhead
 per heap block.

  The heap_mem_ptr parameter may be aligned on any boundary. Beginning bytes
  are skipped until a paragraph boundary is reached. NULL pointers must not
