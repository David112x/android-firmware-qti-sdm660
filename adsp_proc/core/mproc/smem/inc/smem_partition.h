when       who     what, where, why
--------   ---     ----------------------------------------------------------
11/11/16   rv      SMEM Version 0x000C0000 changes.
04/20/15   rs      Increased max number of partitions 
10/09/13   bt      Add offset_mapped_un/cached to smem_partition_info_type.
06/25/13   pa      Added canary and padding size to allocation header.
                   Changed documentation and naming from 'upwards' to 
                   'uncached' and 'downwards' to 'cached' to avoid confusion.
                   Removed list references and smem_partition_item_info_type.
04/24/13   pa      Initial version.
