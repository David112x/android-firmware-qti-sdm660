 * available upon completion of the call depending on the node's
 * dependencies.  This mirrors the functionality of npa_define_node().

 * the previous resource state if the node has valid clients.  If no
 * clients exist, the resources will be re-initialized with the default
 * state vector. In either case, an enabled node will have its driver
 * function invoked with an INITIALIZE client, so it can reset as
 * necessary.  
 *
 * If the default state vector is NULL, resources will be initialized

 * to define the resource (i.e., the first invocation) and not on
 * subsequent invocations, and if you are using this function in that
 * circumstance, the expectation is that the driver can be unloaded and
 * the framework has no way to validate the callback function pointer
