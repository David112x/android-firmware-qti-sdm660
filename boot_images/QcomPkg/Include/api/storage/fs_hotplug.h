 * @defgroup hotplug_module Hotplug Module
 *
 * Hotplug supports removable media (MMC/SD, USB Mass storage) through the
 * notion of a hotplug moudle.  This module keeps track of devices in the
 * system, and performs auto mounting and unmounting of the appropriate
 * mountpoints, so that these devices appear in the filesystem namespace.
 *
 * Some devices, such as USB mass storage, are able to notify us on
 * significant events, such as enumeration and device removal.
 * Automounting these devices is merely a matter of responding to the
 * appropriate events, and mounting or unmounting the device at the
 * appropriate time.
 *
 * Other devices, such as MMC/SD do not have a consistent way of detecting
 * card insertion.  A design may implement card detection with DAT3, power
 * drain detection, or a physical insertion switch.  The design may also
 * opt to do only software polling.  This module needs to be flexible to
 * these differing needs.
 *
 * Because power consumption is a significant concern in a mobile device,
 * the hotplug module provides calls to enable and disable this periodic
 * polling.  Some suggestions are to enable and disable polling in a
 * similar manner to that used for the backlight.  When the user isn't
 * pressing keys, polling can be disabled.
 *
 * The entire hotplug module is featurized on @b FEATURE_FS_HOTPLUG.

 *
 * Once a hotplug 'hdev' handle is retrieved, it can be passed
 * to these functions to perform direct device access.
 *
 * In most cases, these calls (writes in particular) should be avoided
 * or used only on 'locked' devices so that direct device access does
 * not interfere with use by the FAT filesystem.  Additional
 * coordination may be required if there are multiple device users.
 * These "raw" device calls are to be used carefully.
 *
 * Each of these calls is passed to the appropriate Hotplug Device
 * layer (SD, USB, etc) for handling specific to that device.
 *
 * The common parameters are as follows:
 *
 * @param hdev
 *    This is a pointer to a Hotplug device returned from the
 *    hotplug_open_device function above. This represents the persistent
 *    device handle.
 *
 * @param lba
 *    the Linear Block Address, starting from zero.  This is the number of
 *    the first sector that will be read or written.
 *
 * @param buf
 *    The data buffer to read or write.  In most cases, this buffer should be
 *    located in "DMA-aligned" memory for maximum performance. (Some devices
 *    employ Data Mover hardware that benefits from specific address alignment
 *    in physical memory.)
 *
 * @param block_count
 *    The number of blocks (sectors) to read or write. (A nonsensical 0 value
 *    is not permitted, and may fail or succeed, depending on the device.)
 *
 * @return
 * These functions all return 0 for SUCCESS.
 * Any non-zero value indicates FAILURE, and the specific failure
 * values are device-specific.

 * @defgroup hotplug_notification Hotplug Notification
 *  @ingroup hotplug_module
 * \n \n
 * @b Detailed @b Description \n \n
 * The hotplug module can optionally provide system events like "Card-Inserted"
 * or "Card-Removed" etc. to another AMSS task. In order to receive the events,
 * the user will register with the hotplug module indicating what types of
 * events they would like to receive about a device managed by hotplug. The
 * APIs to register and unregister are declared in the public header file
 * fs_hotplug.h
 *
 * \link ::hotplug_dev_type Hotplug Device Types \endlink \n
 * Hotplug manages several different types of media, both removable and
 * permanent. Tasks can nominate interest in one or all of these devices by
 * registering to receive events from any of these device types.  Each type
 * has an enumerated name declared, and the special type "HOTPLUG_TYPE_ALL"
 * represents a wildcard type, including all of the devices managed by Hotplug.
 *
 *
 * \link ::HOTPLUG_NOTIFY_EVENT_CARD_INSERTED Hotplug Events \endlink \n
 * The users can register for any number or combination of the these events by
 * OR'ing them together and forming an event_mask to supply to the registration
 * API.

 * \link ::hotplug_notify_event_cb Registration Callback function \endlink \n
 * The client's callback function should conform to the above prototype. The
 * hotplug module will call this function whenever it has any event for a
 * device that the client has registered for.
 * @Note The callback functions must perform the minimum amount of processing,
 * and operate as if they are in interrupt context.  Each callback should do no
 * more than record simple state information and set signals, returning as soon
 * as possible. Specifically, calls to other libraries like clock timers and
 * queue functions are prohibited.  No blocking functions are allowed.
 * Extensive computation is to be avoided.
 * The callback functions could be invoked from any task with unknown stack
 * size or priority so callback functions should make every effort to be quick
 * and small.
 *
 *
 * \link ::hotplug_notify_register Registration \endlink \n
 * This registration API allows clients to register with the hotplug module to
 * receive notifications for any set of events for any type of device. After
 * successful registration the clients will receive event notifications from
 * the hotplug module through their callback function.
 *
 *
 * \link ::hotplug_notify_unregister Unregistration \endlink \n
 * The above API would allow the clients to unregister from the hotplug module.
 * After successful unregistration the clients will no longer receive event
 * notifications from the hotplug module.

 * @par Description:
 *   hotplug_checkfat is a utility that validates the integrity of inner
 *   FAT filesystem data structures. NOTE: This feature is only available
 *   when FEATURE_HFAT_CHKFAT is defined. There are 3 classes of errors
 *   within the FAT filesystem that it can detect and fix.
 *
 *   1. Errors within the file allocation table.\n
 *   2. Errors within the directory entries.\n
 *   3. Recovery of lost file chains.\n
 *
 *   Depending on the parameters passed efs_checkfat can either check
 *   for errors and return a bit mask of the error type in the
 *   errors parameter, fix cluster and directory entry errors
 *   and/or recover lost file chains.
 *
 *
 * @param path
 *   pathname of the drive to be checked. ie: /mmc1, /ftl1, etc...
 *
 * @param mode
 *   The mode in which to run hotplug_checkfat. The options are:\n
 *   1. CHKFAT_READONLY - Do NOT make changes, return error mask.\n
 *   2. CHKFAT_FIX - Fix errors and delete lost file chains.\n
 *   3. CHKFAT_FIX_RECOVER - Fix errors and recover lost file chains.\n
 *   4. CHKFAT_ERASE_BAD_CHAIN - Erase bad chains rather than truncate.
 *      Can be OR'd with previous 2 flags.
 *
 * @param callback
 *   This function will get called periodically from checkfat to prevent
 *   from the watch dog timing out. There should not be additional work
 *   performed other than state updates and kicking the watch dog.
 *
 * @param errors
 *   On failure, it returns the errors on this parameter. The possible errors
 *   are ::CHKFAT_BAD_ELEMENT ::CHKFAT_CROSS_CHAINED ::CHKFAT_LOST_CHAIN_FOUND
 *   ::CHKFAT_FATS_INCONSISTENT ::CHKFAT_SHORT_ENTRY_INVALID
 *   ::CHKFAT_BAD_DIR_REFERENCE ::CHKFAT_LONG_ENTRY_INVALID
 *   ::CHKFAT_DIR_DEPTH_EXCEEDED
 *
 * @param param
 *   Parameter passed to the callback function.
 *
 * @return
 *   Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
 *
 * @note Please adjust stack size of the task based on the desired directory
 * depth CHKFAT_MAX_DIR_DEPTH. If this is improperly set, a stack overrun is
 * likely. Also, this function inherently takes time to complete. The time
 * taken corresponds to the size of disk to be checked and the number of
 * directories and files on the disk.
 *
 * @par WARNING
 * Because of the above reason this function should not be called
 * from UI task, since it might lose the events like incoming call and SMS
 * which need to be processed immediately. Instead create a lower priority
 * task that executes this function and UI task can monitor and update the
 * UI as the checkFAT progresses.
 *
 * @par WARNING
 * This revision has a known issue with multiple active HFAT
 * devices. If any other HFAT devices are present but not mounted a
 * potential deadlock condition may arise. The workaround is to ensure all
 * HFAT devices are mounted before hotplug_checkfat is run. To accomplish
 * this all mountable devices must be formatted, after which hotplug_checkfat
 * can be run after all devices have been polled after boot (~30 seconds).
