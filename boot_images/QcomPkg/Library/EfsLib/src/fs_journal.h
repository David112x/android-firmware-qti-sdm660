/* As EFS page and rpage table entries are updated, the changes are
 * committed to a log, but not written immediately to flash.  The
 * memory-journal keeps track of these changes.  The ptable code will
 * always consult the memory journal first before the actual tables, always
 * giving it the current view.
 *
 * Each entry in the memory journal has an associated age.  Entries can be
 * purged from the memory journal by age, forcing their changes to be
 * written to the actual tables.
 *
 * The keys are either page_id or cluster_id (depending on the data).  Each
 * key also as associated with it a key_type, which indicates the
 * particular table that is affected by this entry.

/* The primary parameter of this journal (which determines the size of its
 * structure) is the number of entries that can be made.
 *
 * The maximum number of journal entries is tied to two different
 * characteristics of the device: page size and pages per block. Bigger device
 * page size means bigger log page which means more log entries (and journal
 * entries) are kept for single log page. The biggest log entry takes 13
 * bytes (page move style entries), with rough estimations we can fit max
 * of 39 entries for 512, 157 entries for 2k and so on. Typically 512 page
 * devices have 32 pages per block, 2k have 64 or 128 pages per block. The
 * max number of page move that we will need to do to get free space equal
 * to pages per block plus some possible ptable moves. Given the current
 * characteristics of flash parts, the journal size should be a factor of
 * pages per block because this is the lower limit. To understand why let's
 * look at the scenario where we have to move a whole NAND block. Each page
 * move accounts for 3 entries in the journal, that means a total of 3 * pages
 * per block entries added to move a block. In nand_do_gc() there are some
 * hard coded numbers that limit the number of log pages to 20. We only do GC
 * when we are in a transaction, therefore we can estimate that (when the file
 * system is really dirty) half of them will be used for a transaction and the
 * other half for GC. Note all page moves for one block fit in a single log
 * page. For 64 pages per block the journal size should be 64 * 3 * 10 = 64 *
 * 30 = 1920, it can be rounded to 64 * 32 = 2K.
 *
 * The advantage of reducing the journal size is smaller RAM footprint. A
 * journal that works for 4K and 128 pages per block can work for 512 and 32
 * pages per block but not the other way around.
