 *
 * This module is responsible for both the construction and deconstruction
 * of a canonicalized EFS factory image.  The factory image is a compact
 * representation that can be placed in a fresh flash device (occupying
 * consecutive good blocks).  Upon startup, this code is then able to
 * reconstruct a live filesystem from the image.
