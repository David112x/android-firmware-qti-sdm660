 * of data because of fragmentation, this limit is ignored as far as
 * creating enough free space so that EFS does not encounter the fatal
 * error. So configuring this number to a smaller value would worsen
 * the situation than helping. Since if this number is small, then a
 * lot of dynamic data and old generation static data (even in dynamic
 * region, old generation data would not change much) would mixup
 * leading to a situation of need to GC the old dynamic data over and
 * over since full block worth of non changing data will not come together
 * which would help since that block need not be GC'd because it doesn't
 * contain any garbage at all. So the GC would do more GC if this setting

 * free space because of journal, critical free space can be quite low in
 * terms of pages. But the normal preferred free space would be few blocks.
 *
 * Again the same restrictions as data region GC settings also apply here,
 * that, too lower overhead would cause more GC operation because of
 * interleaving of older generation pages with new generation pages which
