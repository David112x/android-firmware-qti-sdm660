/*
 * Device goes into idle state only when there is no activity for that
 * device. We would set device_idle_state as TRUE in the first call of this
 * function and on subsequent call if the value of device_idle_state remains
 * TRUE then we would call the corresponding hotplug device dispatch
 * function to go to sleep mode.
 *
 * We don't require LOCK protection here, because hotplug task is running in
 * lower priority just above sleep. Hotplug task will be preempted if any other
 * task need to write. By checking the device_idle_state here, if write is
 * preempted we still get correct behavior of waiting for some more time
 * before we generate the timeout dispatch to driver. On the other hand,
 * we should not take global hotplug lock here, since read/write don't take
 * hotplug global locks. Even having per device lock will make read/writes
 * slower. When its in contention, raising the priority of hotplug to generate
 * the timeout dispatch to driver to power down and later doing another
 * initialization, which consumes a lot of time.
 *
 * Device goes into idle state only if there is no activity on that
 * particular slot between 2 consecutive polls. For e.g. if the
 * hotplug_idle_device_evt_duration is being set as 30 mins then the device
 * goes to sleep stage in between 30 mins (minimum) or 60 mins (maximum),
 * only if there is no activity going on device.
