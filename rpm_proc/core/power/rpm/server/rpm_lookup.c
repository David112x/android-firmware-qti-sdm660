// The index a resource is stored at in the 'resources' array above is
// determined by a minimal perfect hash.  That is, when we need to find the
// ResourceData for a particular resource's (type, id) pair, we hash the
// pair and lookup the appropriate index in resources.
//
// Obviously, coming up with a perfect hash for these resources is a bit
// tricky.  We don't know all the possible (type, id) pairs up front, which
// makes the normal apporaches to minimal perfect hashing more difficult.
// Instead we trade startup time for a more time-complex hash table
// construction algorithm.  This is imperfect, but as long as we continue
// to assume that we aren't allowed to have a priori knowledge of (type,
// id) pairs *and* cannot consume any extra memory, we need to trade off
// something, and the only remaining quantity is boot speed.
//
// The way the hash algorithm does the lookup is that it first performs a
// very short MurmurHash3-derived hash of the (type, id) pair with a
// starting seed of 0.  Because we have 2 32-bit input values and wish to
// provide a single 32-bit output value, the hash is quick.
//
// After this first round of hashing it is possible for there to be
// collisions between various (type, id) pairs.  To resolve the collisions
// we use 2-level lookup scheme: the first hash is used to look up a seed
// value for which no collisions exist.
//
// In the first level table, a value of '0' means that no resource has ever hit
// that has index before.  During lookup, if a 0 is found in the first level
// hash, we know that resource does not exist.  When inserting a new resource,
// a value of '0' either means "no collision" or possible "the first
// collision" and it is necessary to check the second level table and check
// if that slot is occupied.
//
// If the first level table has a negative value, that means this is the only
// resource which resolves to this particular hash index.  Therefore, the index
// at which this resource is stored is *directly* at the index (-value - 1).
// If the value is positive, then there was a collision for this resource in
// the past.  The value in the first level table is a seed value for which, if
// the hash of (type, id) is repeated starting from that seed, there will be no
// collision when using the rehashed value to index the second level table.
//
// When inserting a new value, this is all very wishy washy.  This
// algorithm deviates from minimal perfect hashing literature in
// significant ways, and it is possible for the modified hash construction
// algorithm to fail, or take prohibitve computation time (as the time
// complexity of inserting is very unfavorable when finding collisions).
// However, the assumption is that number of resources is relatively small, the
// hash space is generally favorable, and new resources are added infrequently,
// so it should be possible to tweak the algorithm by small amounts if an
// undesireable state is found in production.
