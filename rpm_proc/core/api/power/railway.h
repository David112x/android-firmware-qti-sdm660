// Most voltage rails are voted on by their users directly--their state can be
// sufficiently described as merely a function of voltage (and possibly some
// other bits of mode data).  However, there exist some rails with more complex
// control schemes.
//
// "railway" is a way for rails that require a more complex control scheme to
// implement a sort of collaborative voting interface.  It is intended to
// provide a mechansim for two known requirements:
//
// 1) the ability to couple a clock speed to an aggregated rail request (e.g.,
//    keeping the RPM clock running as fast as possible given the current VDDCX
//    voltage corner
// 2) the ability to provide modifications to actual voltages represented by a
//    corner (e.g., using RapidBridge Core Power Reduction [RBCPR] sensors to
//    adjust the voltage of the rail given some conditions)
//
// The mechanism by which this is enforced is relatively simple.  Upon the
// calling of railway_init, the railway driver will take control of all known
// voter inputs to its associated voltage rails (NPA nodes, RPMFW resources,
// etc.).  The railway driver will aggregate the votes from these sources into
// a sort of tuple.  The first element of thise tuple is the "mode" -- or
// associated "voltage corner" or "characterization point."  The vast majority
// of inputs are supplied in terms of known characterization points, such as
// "clock frequency X requires turbo voltage" and the maximum of these modes is
// used at any time.  The second element is voltage, which is fairly self
// explanatory--it is also aggregated to be the maximum of all requests.
//
// In order to facilitate the advanced control mechansims mentioned above,
// railway allows for the registration of pre-change and post-change callbacks
// on each voltage rail it supports.  These callbacks can then be used to
// implement the algorithms, typically using one of each (pre & post).  The
// callbacks receive input settings--these are the proposed new settings for
// prechange callbacks, and the currently effecitve settings in postchange
// callbacks.  The callback functions then return their desired modifications
// to those settings (which may be no modification at all).
//
// Each time the aggregated vote for a rail controlled by railway changes, the
// following algorithm is used to find the final voltage for the rail and place
// it into effect:
//   1) Determine the new proposed settings.
//   2) Call all prechange callbacks.  If any prechange callback returns a
//      modified setting, consider that the new proposed settings and return to
//      step (1).
//   3) Once all prechange callbacks have agreed on a proposed setting, make
//      that setting effective (i.e., program it in the PMIC).
//   4) Call all postchange callbacks.  If any postchange callback returns a
//      modified setting, consider that the new proposed settings and return to
//      step (1).
//   5) Once all postchange callbacks have agreed the existing setting is
//      satisfactory, the update is complete.
//
// The above process has the *potential* to be lengthy, but in practice the two
// features that railway supports (SVS and RBCPR) don't cause many unnecessary
// cycles back to step (1), and the transitions are relatively quick.
//
// SVS can be implemented as follows:
//  - a pre-change callback which needs to implement the following logic:
//      - if the voltage corner is being lowered and the clock required is
//        higher than that corner supports, then propse new settings with the
//        minimum required corner
//      - if the voltage corner is being lowered and the clock required is at
//        or below the level the proposed corner supports, then lower the clock
//        speed to the maximum clock supported by that corner
//  - a post-change callback which needs to implement the following logic:
//      - ensure the clock is running at the maximum speed for the selected
//        corner
//      - in practice, this may raise the clock speed if the corner was raised
//  - if an event occurs that causes a higher clock rate to become necessary,
//    railway_refresh can be used to begin another voltage adjustment pass.
//
// RBCPR can be implemented as follows:
//  - a pre-change callback that modifies the voltage (but not the corner!) to
//    some initial setting
//  - a post-change callback which establishes that voltage as sufficient, and
//    potentially modifies the voltage further if more voltage is required
//  - the post-change callback may additionally set up periodic/continuous
//    monitoring of the voltage rail.  in the event that continuous monitoring
//    indicates that a change is required, railway_refresh can be used to begin
//    another voltage adjustment pass.
