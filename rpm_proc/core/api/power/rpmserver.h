/* 
 * RPM Resource API
 * 
 * This interface is used to register for control of a resource.  Its goal is
 * to abstract away any functionality that is common across all resources.  As
 * such, it implements the following functionality on behalf of the driver:
 * 
 *      - it provides storage for request data in an efficient manner, so that
 *        the pointer math for buffer lookup is not duplicated
 * 
 *      - it provides a separate translation callback, to allow drivers to
 *        decode incoming requests and compute new request states in whatever
 *        internal representation they see fit (rather than waiting until
 *        application time)
 * 
 *      - it provides an application callback, which will automatically be
 *        invoked to advise the driver of a new client request (hiding the
 *        somewhat complex details about when such applications need to occur
 *        from the driver itself)
 */

/* The following structure comprises the information that a driver may need to
 * decode an incoming request.
 *
 * WARNING: do not rely on the offset of any data member or the overall size of
 * this structure.  Future revisisons may add / reorder fields which should not
 * affect drivers written with this compatibility warning in mind.

/* 
 * This type defines the format the the RPM request service expects of a
 * translation function.  The purpose of the translation function is to apply
 * the requested updates delivered from another client (new_kvps) on top of the
 * request being modified (dest_buffer).
 * 
 * For example, when a new "immediate" resource request is received, the
 * request service takes the following actions:
 *   1) Determine which resource handler should receive the message.
 *   2) Look up the current request for that (resource, id, client) and copy it
 *      into a temporary buffer (dest_buffer).
 *   3) Call the driver's translation function with the dest_buffer and the
 *      incoming key-value pairs of the new request.
 *   4) Call the driver's apply function with the dest_buffer as the
 *      new_request, and the pre-modification buffer as the old_request.
 * 
 * It is important to note that the format of non-KVP buffers (i.e.,
 * dest_buffer, new_request, old_request) is owned by the resource's driver.
 * 
 * Three requirements are placed upon internal formats:
 *   1) The size of the internal format is constant (known at init time).
 *   2) The size does not vary between resources (i.e., if clock 0 and clock 15
 *      have differently sized internal representations, the maximum size will
 *      be used for all clocks).
 *   3) The driver must advise the RPM resource service of the size of the
 *      driver's internal representation as part of the registration of that
 *      driver.
