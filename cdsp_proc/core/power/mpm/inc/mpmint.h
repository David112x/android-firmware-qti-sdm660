  OVERVIEW:     This file contains original MPM driver API calls which
                are obsoleted by new API functions. These empty
                function calls now only re-route to new MPM driver
                API functions with support of wrapper function.
 
  NOTE:         This file will be deprecated following migration of
                outside teams to DAL Driver
