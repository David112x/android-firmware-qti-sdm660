<!--
Format of Enter/Exit/Backoff latency fields:
"<Fixed>,<Scaled>"
Fixed - Unscaled value that is always added to each frequency table entry
Scaled - Value that will be scaled at 1:1 ratio according to frequency table entries
         and the initial base profile frequency given via ProfileFreq

Bitwise attribute values (see sleep_mode_attribute enum for full description):
  0x01 - Unused
  0x02 - Multiple Entry
  0x04 - Unused
  0x08 - No automatic latency tracking
  0x10 - LPRM is cacheable

Note that there is no work to actually perform to enter/exit XO as it is taken care of by systemdrivers.
LPR is here to provide an interface to allow or disallow XO
