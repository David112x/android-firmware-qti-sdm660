FUNCTION DIAGBUF_PD_DELETE

DESCRIPTION 
  This function deletes a PD from PD linked list. It calls
  DIAGBUF_REMOVE_PD_FROM_PD_LINK_LIST()
 
PARAMETERS 
 diagbuf_mpd_type *mpd_buf_to_remove - the UserPD diagbuf
                                       pointer.
 
RETURN VALUE 
  TRUE  - If the PD has  been successfully deleted the PD node
  FALSE - If PD is a core PD, it cannot be deleted. Or if
          q_delete_ext returned FALSE i.e. it could not find the
          item in queue Or the PD is not being deleted.

DESCRIPTION 
  This function deletes a PD from diag_main_q PD link list. It calls

PARAMETERS

RETURN VALUE 
  TRUE  - PD has  been successfully deleted the PD node
