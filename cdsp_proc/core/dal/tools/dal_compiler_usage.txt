==================
DAL Compiler Usage
==================

Step 1.
-------
Create the dal.cfg with the following configuration items. Please note all paths are relative to the directory from which run the DAL compiler perl script

#interface input file must be name as DDIXXX.ddi. 
#Sample files are DDISim.ddi 
interface_file   = DDISim.ddi
#interface name must be DalXXXX
interface_name   = DalSim
#include directory points to dal/inc/
include_path     = ..\inc\
#path where code template files are picked from
template_path    = .\templates\
#Directory where auto generated files must be placed at
#make sure this directory exists
code_output_path = ..\drivers\you_driver\
#driver name
driver           = Sim
#Number of devices suppported by your driver
num_devices      = 1
#number of clients
num_clients      = 1
#device ids supported by this driver, if multiple must be "comma" (,) seperarted
device_ids       = DALDEVICEID_SIM_DEVICE


Step 2. 
-------
Run the Perl Script using the windows command prompt

perl DAL.pl <path_to_<dal.cfg>_file -s 

NOTE: "-s" command argument overwrites any existing source file (Dal<driver>.c)
