@brief
Implements various (U)Timer APIs for micro(U)image.

INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS

utimer_init() must be called once before any other timer functions.

utimer_def() must be called, for each timer, 
before other timer functions are used with that timer.

utimer_undef() must be called to free up the timer memory if the timer is not
required any more

A valid timetick estimate is needed before timers can be set.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  Implements the utimer functions


REGIONAL FUNCTIONS

  utimer_init()
    Initializes the utimer subsytem.  Call through rcinit.

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS

  //Todo: Change arguments
  utimer_def_osal(timer, group, tcb, sigs, func, data)
    Defines and initializes a timer.

  utimer_set(timer, set duration, reload duration, unit)
    Sets an inactive timer to expire after a given period of time, or changes
    an active timer to expire after a given period of time.
    Optionally, specifies the timer to repeatly expire with a given period.

  utimer_get(timer, unit)
    Get number of time units before utimer expires

  // Todo: Not available
  //timer_pause(timer)
  //  Suspends an active timer

  //timer_resume(timer)
  //  Resumes a previously "paused" active timer.

  utimer_clr(timer, unit)
    Stops an active timer. Returns 0 if its already inactive
    
  utimer_undef(timer)
    Stops an active timer, relinquishes the handle and frees the timer

  //Todo: Need to remove these apis as they are not supported for utimers
  //timer_clr_task_timers(tcb)
    //Stops all active timers which belong to the specified task.

  //timer_group_enable(timer_group)
    //Enables a timer group.  Timers in the timer group which expired during the
    //diabled period will have their expiry processing executed.

  //timer_group_disable(timer_group)
    //Disables a timer group.  Timers in the timer group will continue to count
    //down, but they will not expire.


INITIALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS

    utimer_init() must be called once before any other timer functions.

    utimer_def() must be called, for each timer, before other timer
    functions are used with that timer.

    A valid timetick estimate is needed before timers can be set.
